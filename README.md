**Introduction** <br>
Using Tensorflow, this project examines the accuracy of the CNN module VGG19 on predicting the binary output of detecting if a room is messy or clean.

**Dataset** <br>
The training set comprises 212 images, half labeled "clean" and half labeled "messy", of which 20% was used as a validation dataset in the training process

**Modeling: Neural Network Layers <br>
